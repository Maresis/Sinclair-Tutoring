#### Getting Started
 Lets get started with making sure you can run these example projects in visual studio code.

 1. The first thing you need to do is make sure you have the appropriate extensions in visual studio
 code. I use [Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.oracle-java) and [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).
 Combined these extensions add all the things you need for syntax, running, and debugging code. With Java, you need to make sure you have a JDK installed on your system, thankfully if you already have one, it adds it automatically to visual studio code. Don't worry if you don't have one though, there are plenty of thorough instructions on how to install a JDK.

 Hopefully, if all went well you should be able to now run the `testHelloWorld` in this folder. Be sure to care fully look at the formatting (packages, classes, etc.) to get a good idea of where tp start with your own programs
